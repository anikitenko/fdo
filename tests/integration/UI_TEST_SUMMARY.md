# Snapshot UI Integration Tests - Summary

## Overview
Automated tests that objectively verify the visual loading states and progress feedback during snapshot operations. These tests eliminate the need for manual testing and prevent regressions in skeleton/loading behavior.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Loading State Visibility (3 tests)
**Purpose**: Verify that the `bp6-skeleton` class appears/disappears correctly on UI components (file tree, tabs, dropdowns).

- ✅ **Skeleton appears when tree loading is true**
  - Verifies skeleton appears immediately when `treeLoading` notification is sent
  - Ensures visual feedback is shown during operations
  
- ✅ **Skeleton disappears when tree loading is false**
  - Confirms skeleton is removed when operation completes
  - Prevents "stuck" loading states
  
- ✅ **No flickering during rapid updates**
  - Monitors DOM mutations to ensure clean state transitions
  - Prevents visual artifacts from multiple rapid updates
  - Validates: false → true → false (max 3 unique states)

### 2. Progress Updates (3 tests)
**Purpose**: Verify that progress bars and file counts display correctly during snapshot operations.

- ✅ **Progress displays during snapshot creation**
  - Tests progress bar reflects correct percentage (25%)
  - Validates stage messages appear correctly
  
- ✅ **Progress displays during snapshot restoration**
  - Tests progress bar shows restoration progress (60%)
  - Validates file count indicators
  
- ✅ **Progress reaches 100% before completion**
  - Monitors all progress updates with MutationObserver
  - Ensures monotonically increasing values
  - Verifies final value is 100%

### 3. Version Switch Flow (3 tests)
**Purpose**: Verify timing and behavior of loading states during user-initiated version switches.

- ✅ **Loading state appears immediately on switch start**
  - Measures time to skeleton appearance (<100ms)
  - Ensures responsive user feedback
  
- ✅ **Loading state maintained during restoration**
  - Verifies skeleton remains visible throughout operation
  - Tests across multiple time intervals
  
- ✅ **Loading state removed only after completion**
  - Confirms skeleton disappears after operation finishes
  - Prevents premature removal during active restoration

### 4. Initial Load Behavior (1 test)
**Purpose**: Verify silent background restoration on app startup.

- ✅ **No skeleton during silent initial load**
  - Confirms no `treeLoading` notification on initial restore
  - Validates silent background operation
  - Ensures smooth startup experience

### 5. Success Notifications (2 tests)
**Purpose**: Verify completion messages show correct operation details.

- ✅ **Duration displays correctly for milliseconds**
  - Tests format: "350ms" for durations <1000ms
  
- ✅ **Duration displays correctly for seconds**
  - Tests format: "2.5s" for durations ≥1000ms
  - Validates decimal precision

## Key Technical Insights

### Test Component Architecture
- **`TestLoadingComponent`**: Mimics `FileBrowserComponent` behavior
  - Subscribes to `treeLoading` notifications
  - Applies `bp6-skeleton` class conditionally
  - Lightweight alternative to mounting full component tree

### Mocking Strategy
- **BlueprintJS**: Mocked with minimal implementations
- **Monaco Editor**: Fully mocked (not needed for UI tests)
- **Notifications System**: Custom mock with observable pattern
- **React Testing Library**: Provides DOM manipulation and querying

### Observable Patterns
```javascript
// MutationObserver tracks DOM changes
const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
    const hasSkeleton = !!container.querySelector('.bp6-skeleton');
    stateChanges.push({ time: Date.now(), hasSkeleton });
});
```

## Benefits

1. **Objective Verification**: No more "I see X" vs "It looks like Y" ambiguity
2. **Regression Prevention**: Automated CI/CD integration catches visual bugs
3. **Performance Metrics**: Timing assertions ensure <100ms feedback
4. **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specification
5. **Refactoring Safety**: Can confidently change implementation

## Test Environment

- **Jest Environment**: `jsdom` (via `@jest-environment` docblock)
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Assertion Library**: `@testing-library/jest-dom`
- **Execution Time**: ~1.1s for all 12 UI tests
- **DOM Manipulation**: MutationObserver for real-time monitoring

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- [ ] Test multi-file restoration (10+ files)
- [ ] Test error states and rollback UI
- [ ] Test storage warning banners
- [ ] Test accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
- [ ] Test concurrent operations (rapid version switches)
- [ ] Visual regression tests (screenshot comparison)

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run only UI tests
npm test -- tests/integration/snapshot-ui.test.js

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage tests/integration/snapshot-ui.test.js

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch tests/integration/snapshot-ui.test.js
```

## Maintenance

- Update mocks when BlueprintJS/Monaco versions change
- Add new tests when UI behavior changes
- Review timing assertions if hardware changes
- Keep test descriptions synchronized with implementation
