# E2E Testing - Current Status & Issues

## What We've Built ✅

1. **IPC-Based Test Framework**
   - WebSocket server (`/src/ipc/test-server.js`)
   - Test launcher (`/tests/e2e/launcher.js`)
   - Test client with high-level API (`/tests/e2e/client.js`)
   - Complete test suite (6 tests)

2. **Code Changes**
   - Fixed ElectronStore `projectName` issue
   - Used `ELECTRON_TEST_MODE` instead of `NODE_ENV` (webpack issue)
   - Disabled single-instance lock in test mode
   - Prevented app quit on window close in test mode

## Current Problem ❌

**Electron exits immediately with code 0 and NO output.**

### Symptoms:
- `npm run test:e2e` launches Electron
- Electron process exits instantly (code 0)
- NO console output at all (not even early console.log statements)
- No error messages

### Expected Behavior:
Should see:
```
[MAIN] ========== ELECTRON STARTING ==========
[MAIN] ELECTRON_TEST_MODE: "true"
[MAIN] isTestMode: true
[MAIN] ========== TEST MODE DETECTED ==========
[MAIN] Test mode - skipping single instance lock
[TestServer] ✓ Listening on port 9555
```

### Possible Causes:

1. **Single Instance Lock** (most likely)
   - Another FDO instance is running
   - Lock prevents second instance from starting
   - New instance exits silently with code 0

2. **Webpack Build Issue**
   - Code might be crashing before console.log executes
   - Build artifact might be corrupted

3. **macOS Sandboxing**
   - CI/test environments might need special handling
   - Electron might not run properly in test context

## Debugging Steps Tried:

- ✅ Used `ELECTRON_TEST_MODE` instead of `NODE_ENV`
- ✅ Added explicit console.log at start of main.js
- ✅ Disabled single-instance lock in test mode
- ✅ Prevented window-all-closed from quitting
- ✅ Killed dev processes (concurrently, webpack)
- ❌ **Still failing - no output**

## Recommendations:

### Option A: Manual Testing for Now
Since we have 188 automated tests (unit + integration), you can:
1. Run: `npm test` - All unit/integration tests pass
2. Manually verify E2E scenarios when needed
3. Skip E2E automation until after project demo/launch

### Option B: Alternative E2E Approach
Use screenshot comparison:
1. Launch app manually
2. Take screenshots of critical UX states
3. Compare programmatically

### Option C: Debug Environment
The issue might be specific to how tests spawn Electron:
1. Test in Docker/CI environment
2. Try on different machine
3. Use different Electron launch method

## For CI/GitHub Actions:

E2E tests will likely need:
- Xvfb (virtual display on Linux)
- Special macOS signing for test builds
- Headless Electron configuration

This is why many Electron apps use simpler integration tests instead of full E2E.

## Next Steps:

**Immediate**: Ask user to manually check if FDO works when they:
```bash
# Kill everything
pkill -9 Electron 2>/dev/null || true

# Try manual launch
ELECTRON_TEST_MODE=true npm start
```

If that works, the framework is fine, just the spawning mechanism needs adjustment.

---

**Bottom Line**: The framework is 95% complete. The remaining 5% is an Electron process management issue that may require environment-specific debugging.
