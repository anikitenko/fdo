# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix UI Test Launches and Address Failing Tests

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 30, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS**: The specification focuses on user scenarios (developers running tests, content display) without diving into implementation specifics. While it mentions technologies like "Electron" and "Monaco editor," these are necessary domain terms, not implementation choices being made.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS**: All 24 functional requirements are testable and measurable. No clarification markers present. Requirements follow MUST/SHOULD pattern and are specific enough to validate.

### Success Criteria Assessment
✅ **PASS**: All 10 success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: 95% success rate
- SC-002: 7/7 tests passing
- SC-003: 2 seconds for content display
- SC-004: 3 seconds for version switches
- SC-005: Exactly 2 transitions
- SC-006: 60 seconds for full suite
- SC-007: Deterministic pass/fail
- SC-008-010: 100% rates

### Edge Cases Assessment
✅ **PASS**: Five edge cases identified covering:
- Electron launch failures
- Concurrent test runs
- Slow editor initialization
- Partial content loading
- Rapid version switches

### Scope Assessment
✅ **PASS**: "Out of Scope" section clearly defines boundaries:
- Visual regression testing (future)
- Windows testing (future)
- Performance optimization beyond re-renders
- Coverage expansion
- Mock improvements
- Multi-process testing

### Dependencies Assessment
✅ **PASS**: Dependencies and assumptions sections are comprehensive:
- 8 explicit assumptions about environment
- External, internal, and environment dependencies listed
- Clear version numbers where applicable

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Focused on user value and outcomes
- Technology-agnostic in success criteria
- Properly scoped with clear boundaries
- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phases

No updates required. Proceed to planning phase.
