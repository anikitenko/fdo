# Feature Specification: Editor Window Close Reliability Fix

**Feature Branch**: `006-fix-editor-close`  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "need to fix a problem when closing editor window and prompt appears.. in rare cases after clicking "Yes" the window is not closing.. I need a clean fix/solution for this"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-28

- Q: When a close operation fails after the user confirms "Yes" (in those rare cases), what should the user experience? → A: Window force-closes after 2-3 second timeout regardless of success/failure
- Q: When the user clicks "Cancel" or "No" on the close confirmation prompt, what should happen to subsequent close attempts? → A: Prompt dismisses, window stays open, user can close again later with fresh prompt
- Q: When a user rapidly clicks the close button multiple times before the first confirmation prompt can appear, what should the system do? → A: Ignore additional close requests until first prompt is dismissed (queue at most one pending close)
- Q: How should the system handle window close attempts when the window reference becomes null or invalid (e.g., window already destroyed)? → A: Check window validity before any operation; if invalid, skip close operation silently and clean up listeners
- Q: What should happen if a window close event is triggered programmatically (e.g., via code or OS-level action) while a user confirmation prompt is already visible and pending user response? → A: Treat it the same as user clicking close again - ignore the programmatic request while prompt is active

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Reliable Window Close After Confirmation (Priority: P1)

A user finishes editing a plugin and clicks the window's close button. A confirmation prompt appears warning that changes will be discarded unless a snapshot is created. When the user clicks "Yes", the editor window must close reliably every time, regardless of how many times the close operation is attempted.

**Why this priority**: This is the core issue that prevents users from closing the editor window. It directly impacts user workflow and creates frustration when the window becomes "stuck" open. This is a critical bug fix that affects the fundamental user interaction pattern.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening an editor window, attempting to close it, confirming "Yes" on the prompt, and verifying the window closes. The test can be repeated multiple times in succession to verify reliability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an editor window is open with unsaved changes, **When** user clicks the window close button and confirms "Yes" on the prompt, **Then** the window closes immediately
2. **Given** user previously attempted to close the window but it failed, **When** user tries to close again and confirms "Yes", **Then** the window closes successfully on this attempt
3. **Given** an editor window is open, **When** user attempts to close the window multiple times in quick succession (clicking close, confirming, clicking close again), **Then** each confirmation properly closes the window without requiring application restart
4. **Given** user clicks the close button and the confirmation prompt appears, **When** user cancels the prompt, **Then** the window stays open and subsequent close attempts show a fresh prompt without any degradation

### User Story 2 - Graceful Reload Confirmation (Priority: P2)

A user is working in the editor and accidentally presses Ctrl+R (or Cmd+R on Mac) to reload. A confirmation prompt appears warning about potential data loss. When the user confirms the reload, the window must reload reliably.

**Why this priority**: While related to the close functionality, reload is less frequently used and has the same underlying issue. Fixing the close issue will also fix the reload issue since they share the same pattern.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening an editor window, pressing Ctrl+R/Cmd+R, confirming the reload prompt, and verifying the window reloads. Can verify the reload handler works multiple times without degradation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an editor window is open, **When** user presses Ctrl+R or Cmd+R and confirms the reload prompt, **Then** the window reloads successfully
2. **Given** user previously confirmed a reload that may have failed, **When** user attempts to reload again and confirms, **Then** the reload executes properly without requiring application restart

### Edge Cases

- When the user rapidly clicks the close button multiple times, additional close requests are ignored until the first confirmation prompt is dismissed
- If the window close event is triggered programmatically while a user confirmation is pending, the programmatic request is ignored (treated same as multiple user clicks)
- When the window reference becomes null or invalid (e.g., already destroyed), the system checks validity before operations and silently skips close operation while cleaning up listeners
- If IPC communication between renderer and main process is interrupted during the close sequence, the timeout mechanism (2-3 seconds) ensures the window force-closes regardless
- How does the system behave if multiple editor windows are open and one fails to close?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST handle multiple window close confirmation attempts without degradation
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain active listeners for window close approval events throughout the window's lifetime
- **FR-003**: System MUST verify window validity before attempting to destroy or manipulate the window reference; if window is invalid, skip close operation silently and clean up listeners
- **FR-004**: System MUST clean up event listeners properly when the editor window is destroyed
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle window reload confirmations with the same reliability as close confirmations
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent race conditions between close event triggers and confirmation responses
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure confirmation handlers remain active even if previous confirmation attempts failed or were cancelled
- **FR-008**: System MUST force-close the editor window after a 2-3 second timeout following user confirmation if normal close operation does not complete
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to cancel the close confirmation and retry closing with a fresh prompt at any time without state degradation
- **FR-010**: System MUST ignore additional close requests (both user-initiated and programmatic) while a confirmation prompt is active, preventing multiple overlapping prompts

### Key Entities

- **Editor Window**: The Electron BrowserWindow instance that hosts the plugin editor, including its lifecycle management and IPC communication channels
- **Close Confirmation**: The user interaction flow that includes the close event trigger, confirmation prompt display, user response, and window destruction sequence
- **IPC Handler**: The inter-process communication mechanism that bridges the renderer process (UI) and main process (window management), specifically for close and reload approval events

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can close the editor window on the first confirmation attempt 100% of the time under normal conditions
- **SC-002**: Editor window closes successfully even after previous failed close attempts without requiring application restart
- **SC-003**: System maintains window close reliability across 50+ consecutive close-and-reopen cycles in testing
- **SC-004**: Window close operation completes within 500 milliseconds of user confirmation under normal conditions, or within 3 seconds maximum via timeout fallback
- **SC-005**: No orphaned editor windows remain open after user confirms close action (ensured by timeout mechanism)
- **SC-006**: Zero occurrences of "stuck" editor windows that require force quit or application restart in production use
