# Specification Quality Checklist: Editor Window Close Reliability Fix

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 28, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for planning phase.

### Validation Notes

- **Content Quality**: The spec focuses entirely on user experience and system behavior without mentioning specific implementation technologies (though IPC and Electron are mentioned as existing architectural components that define the problem space, not as implementation choices)
- **Requirement Completeness**: All 7 functional requirements are testable and clearly defined with measurable success criteria
- **Success Criteria**: All 6 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (100% reliability, 500ms completion time, 50+ test cycles, zero stuck windows)
- **Edge Cases**: 5 specific edge cases identified covering race conditions, invalid references, rapid interactions, and multi-window scenarios
- **User Scenarios**: 2 prioritized user stories (P1 for close, P2 for reload) each with clear independent test descriptions and acceptance scenarios

### Assumptions Documented

The specification makes the following reasonable assumptions based on the existing codebase:
- The application uses Electron framework (evident from project structure and user description context)
- Editor windows can be closed via standard window close button
- A confirmation prompt mechanism already exists
- The issue is intermittent and related to multiple close attempts
- Both close and reload operations share similar confirmation patterns

## Next Steps

Specification is ready for:
- `/speckit.clarify` - To clarify any questions or gather additional context if needed
- `/speckit.plan` - To begin implementation planning phase
