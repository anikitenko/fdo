**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Feature**: 002-fix-asar-unpacked-deps

---

## ✅ Automated Verification (Completed)

### Package Contents
- [x] **Unpacked packages count**: 3 (expected: 3)
  ```
  app.asar.unpacked/dist/main/node_modules/
  ├── @anikitenko/
  ├── @esbuild/
  └── esbuild/
  ```

- [x] **No unwanted packages**: Verified no electron, @unrs, or fsevents in unpacked area

- [x] **No root-level node_modules**: Confirmed no unwanted packages at root level

### Build Artifacts
- [x] **webpack build**: Successfully completed with all externals configured
- [x] **electron-builder packaging**: Completed without errors
- [x] **App bundle structure**: Valid Mach-O executable for arm64
- [x] **ASAR integrity**: Main entry point exists at /dist/main/index.js
- [x] **No linting errors**: package.json validated

## ⏳ Manual Verification (Pending User Testing)

### Application Functionality (T013)
The following need to be tested by launching the packaged application:

- [ ] **Application launches**: Double-click `release/mac-arm64/FDO (FlexDevOPs).app`
- [ ] **Main window appears**: UI loads without errors
- [ ] **Plugin system works**: Can access plugin management
- [ ] **Plugin build workflow**: 
  - Can create a new plugin
  - Plugin build process completes
  - Built plugin uses esbuild correctly (since it's unpacked)
- [ ] **FDO SDK functionality**: @anikitenko/fdo-sdk features work correctly
- [ ] **No console errors**: Check Developer Tools for any module loading errors

### Platform Testing (T014)
- [ ] **Windows build**: `npm run dist:win` (if Windows available)
- [ ] **Linux build**: `npm run dist:linux` (if Linux available)

---

## How to Test

### Launch the App
```bash
open "release/mac-arm64/FDO (FlexDevOPs).app"
```

### Check for Module Loading Errors
1. Launch the app
2. Open Developer Tools (View → Toggle Developer Tools or Cmd+Option+I)
3. Check Console for any errors related to:
   - `esbuild`
   - `@esbuild`
   - `@anikitenko/fdo-sdk`

### Test Plugin Workflow
1. Create a new plugin (or open existing)
2. Trigger plugin build process
3. Verify build completes successfully
4. Check that esbuild native binary is accessible

---

## Success Criteria

The fix is considered **fully verified** when:

1. ✅ Package contains exactly 3 unpacked packages (automated - PASSED)
2. ✅ No unwanted dependencies in unpacked area (automated - PASSED)
3. ⏳ Application launches without errors (manual - PENDING)
4. ⏳ Plugin build workflow functions correctly (manual - PENDING)
5. ⏳ No module loading errors in console (manual - PENDING)

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered during manual testing:

1. **Restore backups**:
   - `webpack.main.config.js.backup` → `webpack.main.config.js`
   - Document current package.json build section before reverting

2. **Rebuild**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run dist:mac
   ```

3. **Investigate**:
   - Check if required native binaries are accessible
   - Verify module resolution paths
   - Review extraResources path mappings

---

## Notes

- **Build time**: ~60 seconds for dist/mac
- **Package size impact**: TBD (need to compare with baseline-metrics.md)
- **Platform tested**: macOS arm64 only
- **Automated checks**: All passed ✅
- **Manual checks**: Pending user verification ⏳
