# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Unwanted Dependencies in Packaged Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - The specification focuses on business outcomes (package size reduction, security surface reduction, build process reliability) without specifying technical implementation details. While webpack and electron-builder are mentioned in context, they are referenced as existing tools rather than implementation choices.

✅ **PASS** - The specification emphasizes user value: smaller package size, faster downloads, reduced security surface, and automated verification.

✅ **PASS** - The language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders. Technical terms are explained in context (e.g., "unpacked resources directory" is defined in Key Entities).

✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections are complete: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, and Success Criteria.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are present. All requirements are stated clearly.

✅ **PASS** - All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-005) are testable through package inspection and functional testing.

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria include specific metrics: exact package count (SC-001), size reduction estimate (SC-002), functional parity percentage (SC-003), build time threshold (SC-004), and regression prevention (SC-005).

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are stated in terms of observable outcomes without specifying technical implementation approaches.

✅ **PASS** - Each user story includes multiple acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format.

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases section identifies four relevant scenarios: internal dependencies, platform-specific modules, configuration changes, and transitive dependencies.

✅ **PASS** - The specification clearly bounds the scope to fixing the three-package requirement without expanding into broader packaging improvements.

✅ **PASS** - Assumptions section documents five key assumptions about package sufficiency, runtime usage, configuration accuracy, and tooling capabilities.

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - Functional requirements are directly linked to acceptance scenarios in user stories, providing clear validation criteria.

✅ **PASS** - Three prioritized user stories cover the primary fix (P1), verification process (P2), and beneficial side effects (P3).

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria provide measurable targets for all key outcomes: correctness, size reduction, functional parity, build performance, and regression prevention.

✅ **PASS** - The specification maintains abstraction from implementation throughout all sections.

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, testable, and ready for the planning phase. No clarifications needed from the user.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to develop the implementation plan.
