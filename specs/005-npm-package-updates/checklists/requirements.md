# Specification Quality Checklist: NPM Package Updates and Deprecation Resolution

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All quality checks passed

### Content Quality Assessment
- ✅ Specification focuses on outcomes (clean npm install, no deprecations) rather than implementation
- ✅ Written in terms of developer experience and project health
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are clear
- ✅ Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-010) is testable:
  - FR-001: Can verify by checking package.json versions
  - FR-002: Can verify by running npm install and checking for warnings
  - FR-003: Can verify by running existing tests
  - etc.
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics:
  - SC-001: Zero deprecation warnings (binary pass/fail)
  - SC-002: Zero outdated packages (verifiable via npm outdated)
  - SC-004: Installation time under 2 minutes (measurable)
  - etc.
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of specific tools or approaches)
- ✅ Edge cases identified for common package update scenarios
- ✅ Scope clearly defined with "Out of Scope" section
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions documented

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- ✅ Three prioritized user stories (P1: Resolve deprecations, P2: Update packages, P3: Clean lock file)
- ✅ Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios using Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Each user story is independently testable
- ✅ User stories align with success criteria
- ✅ No implementation leakage (no mention of specific update strategy, tools, or commands)

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for next phase. No issues found that require spec updates.

**Recommendations**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.clarify` if any points need discussion
- Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning
