# Feature Specification: NPM Package Updates and Deprecation Resolution

**Feature Branch**: `005-npm-package-updates`  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Make command npm i clear.. I want to get rid of any deprecations and other stuff.. just to be up to date with all my packages"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-28

- Q: Should updated packages be audited for known security vulnerabilities before being accepted? â†’ A: Yes, run security audit and block updates with high/critical vulnerabilities
- Q: How should the system handle packages that have breaking changes in their latest versions? â†’ A: Skip packages with breaking changes, document them for manual review later
- Q: What triggers a rollback to the previous package versions, and how is rollback performed? â†’ A: Automated rollback if tests fail, manual rollback process documented for production issues
- Q: When a deprecated package has no direct replacement, what action should be taken? â†’ A: Keep deprecated package, document it as technical debt for future resolution
- Q: Should all packages be updated in a single batch, or should they be updated incrementally in smaller groups? â†’ A: Update in batches by type (devDependencies first, then dependencies)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Resolve All Package Deprecation Warnings (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

As a developer, when I run `npm install`, I want to see zero deprecation warnings so that I can be confident the project uses current, supported packages.

**Why this priority**: Deprecation warnings indicate packages that may become unsupported or insecure. This is critical for long-term maintainability and security.

**Independent Test**: Run `npm install` and verify deprecation warnings are minimized (only warnings for packages with no replacement should remain, and they must be documented). Can be tested immediately after package updates are applied.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the project has outdated packages with deprecation warnings, **When** developer runs `npm install`, **Then** deprecation warnings are resolved where replacements exist (any remaining warnings are documented as technical debt)
2. **Given** packages have been updated, **When** developer checks package.json and package-lock.json, **Then** packages reference current, non-deprecated versions where replacements exist
3. **Given** deprecated packages have been replaced, **When** application is built and run, **Then** all functionality works as before (no regressions)

---

### User Story 2 - Update All Packages to Latest Compatible Versions (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want all npm packages updated to their latest compatible versions so that the project benefits from bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches.

**Why this priority**: Staying up-to-date with package versions reduces technical debt and security vulnerabilities. This is important but slightly less critical than removing deprecations.

**Independent Test**: Run `npm outdated` before and after updates. Verify all packages show no outdated versions or only show minor/patch updates that are within acceptable ranges.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** packages have available updates, **When** packages are updated, **Then** `npm outdated` shows no packages with major version updates available
2. **Given** packages are updated, **When** developer reviews package.json, **Then** version ranges still use appropriate semver constraints (^, ~)
3. **Given** packages are at latest compatible versions, **When** CI/CD pipeline runs, **Then** all tests pass without modification

---

### User Story 3 - Clean and Optimize Package Lock File (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want a clean package-lock.json file with resolved dependencies so that installations are fast, reproducible, and conflict-free.

**Why this priority**: A clean lock file ensures consistent installations across environments. This is good practice but less critical than the actual package updates.

**Independent Test**: Delete node_modules and package-lock.json, run `npm install`, verify installation completes quickly without warnings or conflicts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** package-lock.json exists, **When** developer runs `npm install`, **Then** installation completes in reasonable time with no conflicts
2. **Given** fresh installation, **When** developer inspects package-lock.json, **Then** all dependency versions are explicitly locked
3. **Given** clean lock file, **When** multiple developers install, **Then** everyone gets identical dependency trees

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a package has no direct replacement for deprecated functionality? (Resolved: Keep and document as technical debt)
- How does system handle packages with breaking changes in latest versions? (Resolved: Skip and document for manual review)
- What if updated packages introduce incompatibilities with existing code?
- How are peer dependency conflicts resolved?
- What happens when package updates require changes to application code?
- What happens when an updated package has known security vulnerabilities (high/critical severity)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST update all outdated npm packages to their latest compatible versions (latest minor/patch within current major version, skipping breaking changes)
- **FR-002**: System MUST resolve all deprecation warnings shown during `npm install` by updating to non-deprecated versions where replacements exist
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing application code
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve appropriate semver version ranges in package.json (^, ~, or exact versions)
- **FR-005**: System MUST regenerate package-lock.json with updated, conflict-free dependency tree
- **FR-006**: System MUST identify packages with breaking changes (major version bumps), skip updating them, and document them in a report for manual review
- **FR-007**: System MUST verify all updates through running existing test suite
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate a report listing all skipped packages with breaking changes, including their current versions, available versions, and links to changelog documentation
- **FR-009**: System MUST update both direct dependencies and transitive dependencies
- **FR-010**: System MUST resolve peer dependency conflicts
- **FR-011**: System MUST run security audit on all updated packages and block updates with high or critical severity vulnerabilities
- **FR-012**: System MUST automatically rollback package updates if automated test suite fails after updates are applied
- **FR-013**: System MUST preserve previous package.json and package-lock.json versions to enable manual rollback if production issues are discovered
- **FR-014**: System MUST document deprecated packages that have no direct replacement as technical debt, including deprecation reason and monitoring plan for security updates
- **FR-015**: System MUST update packages in two batches: devDependencies first (with testing), then dependencies (with testing), to minimize risk and enable incremental validation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Package Dependency**: Direct dependency listed in package.json with version constraint
- **Transitive Dependency**: Indirect dependency required by direct dependencies  
- **Deprecation Warning**: Notice that a package version is no longer recommended
- **Version Constraint**: Semver specification defining acceptable version range (^1.0.0, ~2.1.0, etc.)
- **Package Lock Entry**: Exact resolved version of package with integrity hash
- **Breaking Changes Report**: Document listing packages with major version updates that were skipped, including version information and changelog links
- **Rollback Checkpoint**: Saved state of package.json and package-lock.json before updates, enabling restoration if issues are discovered
- **Technical Debt Report**: Document listing deprecated packages with no replacement, including deprecation reason, current version, and security monitoring plan
- **Update Batch**: Group of packages updated together (either devDependencies or dependencies), tested as a unit before proceeding to next batch

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Running `npm install` produces zero deprecation warnings for packages with available replacements (remaining warnings documented as technical debt)
- **SC-002**: Running `npm outdated` shows zero packages with available major version updates
- **SC-003**: All existing automated tests pass without modification after package updates
- **SC-004**: `npm install` completes in under 2 minutes on a clean install (from cached packages)
- **SC-005**: Application builds and runs successfully with updated packages
- **SC-006**: No peer dependency warnings or conflicts appear during installation
- **SC-007**: Package-lock.json is under 5MB in size (optimized dependency tree)
- **SC-008**: Security audit reports zero high or critical severity vulnerabilities in updated packages
- **SC-009**: If test suite fails after package updates, system successfully rolls back to previous package versions within 5 minutes
- **SC-010**: DevDependencies are updated and tested before dependencies are updated, enabling early detection of build/test tool issues

## Assumptions

- Project uses npm (not yarn or pnpm) as package manager
- Existing test suite provides adequate coverage to catch regressions
- Updates will target latest stable versions within semver compatibility
- Breaking changes requiring code modifications are acceptable if documented
- CI/CD pipeline exists to validate changes
- Development, staging, and production environments can be updated sequentially

## Dependencies

- Access to npm registry (npmjs.com) for package downloads
- Node.js version compatibility with updated packages
- Adequate test coverage to validate updates
- CI/CD pipeline for automated validation
- Version control system (Git) for preserving previous package versions and enabling rollback

## Out of Scope

- Migrating from npm to alternative package managers (yarn, pnpm)
- Updating Node.js version if required by new packages
- Refactoring application code to use new package APIs (unless required for critical security updates)
- Adding new packages or removing unused dependencies (separate cleanup task)
- Performance optimization beyond what new package versions provide

## Risks

- **Risk 1**: Updated packages may introduce breaking API changes
  - *Mitigation*: Skip packages with breaking changes, review changelogs, test thoroughly, update in batches (devDependencies first, then dependencies)
  
- **Risk 2**: Package updates may cause unexpected runtime behavior
  - *Mitigation*: Automated rollback if tests fail, deploy to staging first, monitor for errors, documented manual rollback process for production issues
  
- **Risk 3**: Some deprecated packages may have no suitable replacements
  - *Mitigation*: Document alternatives, consider forking if necessary
  
- **Risk 4**: Updated packages may have performance regressions
  - *Mitigation*: Benchmark before/after, monitor production metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Clarification Phase** (`/speckit.clarify`): Review and resolve any unclear requirements
2. **Planning Phase** (`/speckit.plan`): Create detailed implementation plan with task breakdown
3. **Implementation**: Execute package updates with testing at each stage
4. **Validation**: Verify all success criteria are met before deployment
