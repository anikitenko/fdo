# Tasks: Dynamic CLI Path Resolution

**Feature**: `004-dynamic-cli-paths`  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-dynamic-cli-paths/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in specification - manual testing approach per plan.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Project Type**: Single desktop application (Electron-based)
- **Primary file**: `src/utils/installFDOCLI.js` (existing, will be refactored)
- **Supporting files**: Uses existing utilities, may extract helpers

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Prepare logging infrastructure for structured logging per research.md

- [x] T001 Configure electron-log debug mode in src/main.js for CLI installation operations
- [x] T002 [P] Add log prefix constants for CLI operations in src/utils/installFDOCLI.js

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core helper functions that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - helper functions tested and working

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Install CLI from Custom Application Location (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable CLI installation regardless of where FDO is installed (custom paths, default paths, development)

**Independent Test**: Install FDO to a custom location (e.g., `D:\CustomApps\FDO` on Windows or `/opt/custom/FDO` on Linux), then trigger CLI installation. The CLI should work correctly without errors.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. FDO installed to custom directory ‚Üí CLI installer detects actual app path and creates working wrapper
2. FDO installed to default system location ‚Üí CLI installer works (backward compatibility)
3. CLI installation triggered ‚Üí no hardcoded path assumptions cause failure

- [ ] T028 [US1] Test idempotent behavior (re-running installation skips correctly)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - CLI installs from any app location

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Install CLI with Non-Standard System Paths (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable CLI installation when default system paths are not writable or don't exist

**Independent Test**: Test on a system where `/usr/local/bin` is not writable or doesn't exist. The installer should use an appropriate alternative location (e.g., user's local bin directory).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Default CLI path not writable ‚Üí installer uses appropriate fallback location
2. System has custom PATH configurations ‚Üí installer detects and uses PATH-accessible directory
3. User has limited permissions ‚Üí installer succeeds using user-writable locations

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T029 [US2] Implement `selectInstallPath(platform, paths)` helper in src/utils/installFDOCLI.js per contracts

- [ ] T042 [US2] Test installation to ~/bin fallback on Unix systems
- [ ] T043 [US2] Test Windows installation to %LOCALAPPDATA% (no fallback needed)
- [ ] T044 [US2] Verify CLI works correctly from fallback locations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - CLI installs to best available path

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Uninstall CLI from Any Location (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable clean CLI uninstallation regardless of where it was installed

**Independent Test**: Install CLI, then change system configuration or reinstall FDO to a different location. Uninstall should still find and remove the CLI installation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. CLI installed using dynamic paths ‚Üí uninstaller locates and removes correctly
2. CLI installed with previous version (hardcoded paths) ‚Üí uninstaller checks multiple locations and removes
3. No CLI currently installed ‚Üí uninstaller reports clearly that nothing found

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T045 [US3] Refactor `removeFDOCLI()` in src/utils/installFDOCLI.js to check all possible CLI paths
- [x] T046 [US3] Add logic to check legacy hardcoded paths in `removeFDOCLI()` per FR-011
- [x] T047 [US3] Add logic to check all fallback paths in `removeFDOCLI()` per research R2
- [x] T048 [US3] Add idempotent behavior for uninstall (report success if not found) in `removeFDOCLI()`
- [x] T049 [US3] Add info-level logging for uninstall operations in `removeFDOCLI()`
- [x] T050 [US3] Add clear error messages when CLI found but cannot be removed in `removeFDOCLI()`
- [x] T051 [US3] Update Windows uninstall to optionally remove from PATH in `removeFDOCLI()` per research R3
- [ ] T052 [US3] Test uninstall of CLI from /usr/local/bin on macOS
- [ ] T053 [US3] Test uninstall of CLI from ~/.local/bin fallback on macOS

- [ ] T059 [US3] Test uninstall with sudo permission handling on macOS/Linux
- [ ] T060 [US3] Test Windows PATH cleanup after uninstall

**Checkpoint**: All installation/uninstallation scenarios should work cleanly

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Portable FDO Installation (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Support CLI installation from portable/movable FDO locations

**Independent Test**: Install FDO to a portable drive, install CLI, then move the drive to a different mount point or machine. Re-running CLI installation should update paths appropriately.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. FDO on portable drive at location A ‚Üí CLI installs and works correctly
2. FDO moved to location B ‚Üí re-running CLI installation updates wrapper to new location
3. FDO location changes ‚Üí CLI either works or provides clear guidance to reinstall

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [x] T061 [US4] Ensure `detectApplicationPath()` works correctly when run from portable media
- [x] T062 [US4] Verify idempotent installation updates wrapper when path changes per clarification
- [x] T063 [US4] Add warning logging when portable installation detected in `installFDOCLI()`
- [ ] T064 [US4] Test CLI installation from USB drive on macOS
- [ ] T065 [US4] Test CLI installation from portable drive on Windows
- [ ] T066 [US4] Test CLI re-installation after moving portable drive
- [ ] T067 [US4] Test CLI from network share (edge case)
- [ ] T068 [US4] Verify error messages guide users to reinstall when CLI breaks after move

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional including portable scenarios

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [x] T069 [P] Review and refine all error messages for consistency and actionability
- [x] T070 [P] Review and refine all log messages for consistency across platforms
- [x] T071 Verify all functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-019) are implemented

- [x] T073 [P] Add JSDoc comments to all helper functions in src/utils/installFDOCLI.js
- [x] T074 Code cleanup and remove any dead code from old hardcoded approach
- [ ] T075 Performance validation (installation < 30s, detection < 5s, idempotent < 1s)
- [ ] T076 [P] Update quickstart.md with any implementation notes if needed
- [ ] T077 Test all edge cases from spec.md (paths with spaces, multiple installations, dev environment, etc.)
- [ ] T078 Cross-platform validation test run (all scenarios on all platforms)
- [x] T079 [P] Update documentation strings in IPC handlers if interface changed
- [ ] T080 Final validation against specification requirements checklist

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (P1) can start immediately after Foundational
  - US2 (P2) depends on US1 completion (extends installation logic)
  - US3 (P2) can run parallel to US2 (different function - `removeFDOCLI()`)
  - US4 (P3) depends on US1 and US2 completion (validates portable scenarios)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on US1 - extends installation logic with fallback paths
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - independent function (`removeFDOCLI()`)
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on US1 and US2 - validates existing functionality in portable context

### Within Each User Story

- Setup logging before implementation
- Helper functions before main logic
- Core implementation before platform-specific code
- Implementation before testing
- Manual testing validates each scenario independently
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T001 and T002 can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T003, T004, T005, and T007 can run in parallel (different helpers)
- **Within US1**: Platform-specific refactoring (macOS, Windows, Linux sections) can be parallelized
- **US2 and US3**: Can run in parallel after US1 (US2 extends `installFDOCLI()`, US3 works on `removeFDOCLI()`)
- **Testing**: All test tasks within a story can run in parallel (marked implicitly by different scenarios)
- **Polish Phase**: Documentation, comments, and validation tasks can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch all helper functions in parallel:
Task: "Implement isDevelopmentEnvironment() helper in src/utils/installFDOCLI.js"
Task: "Implement isPathWritable(targetPath) helper in src/utils/installFDOCLI.js"
Task: "Implement detectApplicationPath() helper in src/utils/installFDOCLI.js"
Task: "Implement createWrapperScript(appPath, platform) helper in src/utils/installFDOCLI.js"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 and 3

```bash
# After US1 completes, these can run in parallel:
Task: "Implement selectInstallPath() and fallback logic in installFDOCLI()" (US2)
Task: "Refactor removeFDOCLI() to check all possible paths" (US3)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (logging infrastructure)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (helper functions) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (dynamic path detection + installation)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 across all platforms
5. **MVP READY**: CLI works from any app location

**Why this is the MVP**: User Story 1 solves the core problem (hardcoded paths fail for custom installs). Users get immediate value even without fallback logic or advanced features.

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phase 1 + 2) ‚Üí Helper functions ready (~5-8 tasks, ~2-4 hours)
2. **MVP** (Phase 3) ‚Üí Dynamic path detection working (~21 tasks, ~1-2 days)
   - Test independently across macOS, Windows, Linux
   - Deploy/demo if ready
3. **Fallback Support** (Phase 4) ‚Üí Handles non-standard paths (~16 tasks, ~1 day)
   - Test independently with permission scenarios
   - Deploy/demo
4. **Uninstall** (Phase 5) ‚Üí Clean removal (~16 tasks, ~1 day)
   - Test independently across platforms
   - Deploy/demo
5. **Portable** (Phase 6) ‚Üí Advanced scenario support (~8 tasks, ~0.5 days)
   - Test independently with portable installations
   - Deploy/demo
6. **Polish** (Phase 7) ‚Üí Production-ready (~12 tasks, ~0.5-1 day)
   - Final validation and cleanup

**Total Estimated Effort**: ~5-7 days for complete implementation and testing

### Single Developer Strategy

Work sequentially through phases:
1. Setup ‚Üí Foundational (get helpers working)
2. US1 ‚Üí Test thoroughly ‚Üí Validate MVP
3. US2 ‚Üí Test fallback scenarios
4. US3 (in parallel with US2 review if desired)
5. US4 ‚Üí Test portable scenarios
6. Polish ‚Üí Final validation

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 2-3 developers:

1. **Together**: Complete Setup + Foundational (critical blocking work)
2. **Once Foundational done**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (core dynamic detection)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (uninstall - different function)
3. **After US1 completes**:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (extends US1 with fallbacks)
   - Developer B: Continues US3
4. **After US2 completes**:
   - Developer A: User Story 4 (portable scenarios)
   - Developer B: Finishes US3, starts Polish
5. **Final**: Both collaborate on Polish phase

---

## Testing Approach

**Manual Testing** (per plan.md - no automated tests requested):

### Test Matrix

| Platform | Default Path | Custom Path | Paths w/ Spaces | Dev Env | No Permissions | Fallback | Portable |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|---------|----------------|----------|----------|
| macOS    | T020         | T021        | T027            | T026    | T037, T038     | T041, T042 | T064   |
| Windows  | T022         | T023        | T027            | T026    | T043           | T043     | T065     |
| Linux    | T024         | T025        | T027            | T026    | T039, T040     | T041, T042 | -      |

### Edge Cases to Validate (Phase 7, T077)

- Application path contains spaces (e.g., `FDO (FlexDevOPs).app`)
- Multiple FDO installations (idempotent behavior)
- Target directory doesn't exist and can't be created
- Development environment detection
- Existing CLI from different source (idempotent skip)
- Network paths or cloud-synced directories
- Retry after partial failure (idempotent recovery)

### Success Validation (Phase 7, T072)

- SC-001: CLI installation succeeds on all platforms from any location
- SC-002: 100% success rate for non-default directories
- SC-003: 100% correct handling of paths with spaces/special characters
- SC-004: Automatic fallback selection when primary not writable
- SC-005: 100% successful uninstallation including legacy paths
- SC-006: Installation + verification < 30 seconds
- SC-007: Error messages include paths attempted and recovery instructions
- SC-008: No hardcoded path failures
- SC-009: Successful retry after partial failure (idempotent)

---

## Notes

- **No automated tests**: Manual testing approach per plan.md (automated testing would require multi-platform CI)
- **[P] markers**: Tasks that can run in parallel (different files/functions, no dependencies)
- **[Story] labels**: Map tasks to user stories for traceability and independent testing
- **File paths**: All tasks include exact file paths (primarily `src/utils/installFDOCLI.js`)
- **Idempotent**: Core design principle - safe to retry any operation
- **Logging**: Info for major steps, debug for details (electron-log)
- **Error handling**: All errors returned in result objects, never thrown
- **Platform support**: macOS, Windows, Linux with platform-specific paths and wrappers
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after completing each user story phase (natural checkpoints)
- **MVP = User Story 1**: Solves core problem, delivers immediate value

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 2 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 5 tasks - BLOCKS all user stories

- **Phase 5 (US3 - P2)**: 16 tasks
- **Phase 6 (US4 - P3)**: 8 tasks
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: 12 tasks

**Total**: 80 tasks

**Critical Path**: Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3 (US1) = MVP (~28 tasks)

**Parallel Potential**: 
- Foundational helpers: 4 tasks in parallel
- US2 and US3: ~32 tasks can overlap
- Testing within each story: Multiple test scenarios in parallel
- Polish tasks: ~5 tasks in parallel
