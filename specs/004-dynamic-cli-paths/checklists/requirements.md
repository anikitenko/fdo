# Specification Quality Checklist: Dynamic CLI Path Resolution

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 28, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - The specification focuses on WHAT users need (dynamic path detection, cross-platform support) without specifying HOW to implement beyond necessary technical constraints.

Note: Some references to Electron APIs (e.g., `app.getPath()`) appear in Requirements and Assumptions sections. These are acceptable as they define technical constraints rather than implementation details. The specification remains technology-agnostic in user scenarios and success criteria.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are testable with clear conditions:
- FR-001 through FR-016: Each has verifiable conditions (e.g., "MUST dynamically detect", "MUST validate", "MUST handle")
- Platform-specific requirements clearly scoped
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Edge cases comprehensively identified

### Success Criteria Review
✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-001: Measurable across all platforms (100% success rate)
- SC-002: Measurable in test cases (100% non-default directory support)
- SC-003: Measurable handling of special characters (100%)
- SC-004: Measurable automatic fallback behavior
- SC-005: Measurable uninstallation success (100%)
- SC-006: Time-based metric (under 30 seconds)
- SC-007: Qualitative error message quality
- SC-008: User satisfaction metric (zero reports)

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - Feature is well-scoped and ready for planning:
- Four prioritized user stories (P1-P3) with independent test criteria
- All functional requirements linked to user value
- Clear boundaries defined (what's in scope vs. out of scope)
- Dependencies and assumptions documented

## Notes

**Specification Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phase.

### Minor Observations:
1. Some Electron API references in Requirements section - these are acceptable as they define platform capabilities rather than implementation
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage demonstrates thorough thinking about failure modes
3. Good balance between platform-agnostic high-level goals and platform-specific necessary constraints
4. Assumptions section clearly documents reasonable defaults that don't require user clarification
