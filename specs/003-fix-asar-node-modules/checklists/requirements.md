**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 28, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS** - The specification focuses on WHAT needs to happen (assets must be in ASAR archive) and WHY (plugin functionality, dynamic code execution), without prescribing HOW to implement it. While specific tools (webpack, electron-builder, ASAR) are mentioned, they describe the existing system context rather than implementation choices.

✅ **PASS** - The spec centers on user value: developers need reliable packaging, users need functional plugins. Business needs are clear: prevent runtime failures, enable plugin ecosystem.

✅ **PASS** - Language is accessible to stakeholders. Technical terms are explained in context (e.g., "ASAR Archive" is described as "the packaged file format used by Electron").

✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are concrete and specific.

✅ **PASS** - Requirements are testable:
- FR-001: Can verify directory exists in ASAR
- FR-002: Can inspect and count packages
- FR-003: Can compare build output to ASAR contents
- FR-004-008: All have clear pass/fail criteria

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "all three required packages, verified by automated ASAR extraction"
- SC-002: "100% functionality parity"
- SC-003: "100% accuracy"
- SC-005: "5-15MB"

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic from user perspective:
- SC-001: Focuses on outcome (directory exists with packages) not implementation
- SC-002: Measures plugin functionality, not code structure
- SC-003: Measures build validation accuracy, not validation method
- SC-004: Measures cross-platform consistency
- SC-005: Measures package size impact

✅ **PASS** - Acceptance scenarios comprehensive:
- P1: 4 scenarios covering packaging, runtime access
- P2: 3 scenarios covering validation
- P3: 3 scenarios covering user experience

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases identified: missing webpack config, partial directories, platform differences, ASAR protocols, symbolic links.

✅ **PASS** - Scope clearly bounded: Fix packaging of three specific asset packages, add validation, maintain cross-platform support. Does not expand into general dependency management or plugin system redesign.

✅ **PASS** - Dependencies and assumptions documented in Assumptions section (6 assumptions listed).

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-008) maps to user stories and success criteria.

✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover critical flows:
- P1: Core packaging functionality
- P2: Quality assurance and validation
- P3: User-facing plugin experience

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are comprehensive and aligned with requirements. Each can be independently verified.

✅ **PASS** - Specification maintains focus on desired outcomes without implementation details. References to existing tools (webpack, electron-builder) describe the problem context, not the solution approach.

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, testable, and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

## Notes

- The specification appropriately references existing system components (webpack, ASAR) to provide context about the bug without prescribing implementation details for the fix
- Edge cases are well-documented, particularly around platform differences and ASAR protocol handling
- Success criteria balance quantitative metrics (package size, accuracy percentages) with qualitative outcomes (functionality parity)
