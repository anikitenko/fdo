## Implementation Strategy

### MVP-First Approach

**MVP** = Phase 2 (Foundational) + Phase 3 (User Story 1 - P1)
- Establishes metrics infrastructure (measure before optimize)
- Delivers core startup performance improvements
- Enables single-instance behavior
- Validates against 3-second cold start target

**Incremental Delivery**:
1. **Sprint 1** (Week 1): Phase 1-2 (Setup + Foundational metrics)
2. **Sprint 2** (Week 2): Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Fast Launch)
3. **Sprint 3** (Week 3): Phase 4-5 (User Stories 2-3)
4. **Sprint 4** (Week 4): Phase 6-7 (User Story 4 + Polish)

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Tasks

| Task ID | Risk | Mitigation |
|---------|------|------------|
| T030-T037 | Code splitting breaks navigation | Test all routes; Keep sync import fallback |
| T044-T048 | ASAR breaks native modules | Use asarUnpack; Test thoroughly on all platforms |
| T084-T086 | Platform-specific regressions | Test on real hardware; CI for all platforms |
| T102-T104 | Error handling adds complexity | Keep simple; Follow Electron patterns |

### Rollback Strategy

If any phase fails validation:
1. Revert to previous phase
2. Re-measure with metrics
3. Identify specific bottleneck
4. Fix incrementally
5. Re-validate

Git branch strategy enables easy rollback per phase.
