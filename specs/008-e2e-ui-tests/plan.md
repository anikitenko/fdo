# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES2020+), Electron 25.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: Playwright, Jest, Electron IPC  
**Storage**: N/A (no persistent storage required for tests)  
**Testing**: Playwright for e2e, Jest for unit tests  
**Target Platform**: macOS, Windows, Linux  
**Project Type**: Desktop application (Electron-based)  
**Performance Goals**: Window load time under 2 seconds, UI actions respond within 100ms  
**Constraints**: Must use isolated utility processes for plugins, adhere to Plugin-First Architecture  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user role, no external dependencies, advanced edge cases (e.g., concurrent actions, unexpected shutdowns)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Plugin-First Architecture**: Compliant. All extensibility happens through plugins.
- **Process Isolation**: Compliant. Plugins run in separate utility processes.
- **Declarative Metadata**: Compliant. Plugins declare lifecycle states (`PLUGIN_READY`, `PLUGIN_INIT`, `PLUGIN_RENDER`).
- **Cryptographic Trust Model**: N/A for this feature (no external dependencies).
- **Desktop-Native Platform**: Compliant. ElectronJS ensures desktop-native experience.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
