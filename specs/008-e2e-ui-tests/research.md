# Research: End-to-End UI Tests

## Decision Log

### Decision 1: Testing Framework
- **Decision**: Use Playwright for e2e tests.
- **Rationale**: Playwright provides robust support for Electron applications and cross-platform testing.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Spectron (deprecated), Cypress (limited Electron support).

### Decision 2: Performance Targets
- **Decision**: Window load time under 2 seconds, UI actions respond within 100ms.
- **Rationale**: Aligns with modern application performance standards.
- **Alternatives Considered**: No specific targets (rejected due to lack of measurable goals).

### Decision 3: Error, Empty, and Loading States
- **Decision**: Use custom modals for errors, placeholders for empty states, and spinners for loading states.
- **Rationale**: Enhances user experience and aligns with modern UI practices.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Default browser alerts and placeholders (rejected due to poor UX).

### Decision 4: Edge Cases
- **Decision**: Handle advanced edge cases (e.g., concurrent actions, unexpected shutdowns).
- **Rationale**: Ensures robustness and reliability under complex scenarios.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Basic edge cases only (rejected due to insufficient coverage).

### Decision 5: External Dependencies
- **Decision**: No external dependencies.
- **Rationale**: Simplifies testing and aligns with the application's single-user role.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Integration with external APIs (rejected as unnecessary for this feature).

## Research Tasks

1. Investigate best practices for Playwright in ElectronJS applications.
2. Validate performance targets against real-world benchmarks for Electron apps.
3. Explore advanced edge case handling strategies for concurrent actions and unexpected shutdowns.
