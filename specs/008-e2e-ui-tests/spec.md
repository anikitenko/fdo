# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- **Boundary Condition**: The application must handle scenarios where the main window fails to load (e.g., missing resources).
- **Error Scenario**: The application must display a user-friendly error message if a plugin fails to initialize.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to execute end-to-end tests for UI components.
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate test results and display them in a user-friendly format.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to view detailed error messages for failed tests.
- **FR-004**: System MUST support advanced edge case handling (e.g., concurrent actions, unexpected shutdowns).
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure all UI components are functional and responsive.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Test Case**: Represents an individual test with attributes like `id`, `name`, `description`, `steps`, and `expectedOutcome`.
- **Test Suite**: Represents a collection of test cases with attributes like `id`, `name`, and `testCases`.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can execute end-to-end tests with a success rate of 95%.
- **SC-002**: Test results are displayed within 2 seconds of execution.
- **SC-003**: 90% of users can complete primary testing tasks without assistance.
- **SC-004**: The system handles 10 concurrent test executions without performance degradation.

# Feature Specification: End-to-End UI Tests

**Feature Branch**: `008-e2e-ui-tests`  
**Created**: October 31, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create e2e tests using jUnit to test ElectronJS application's UI"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Verify Main Window (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want the main application window to load correctly so that I can interact with the application.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the application launches successfully, which is critical for all other functionality.

**Independent Test**: Launch the application and verify the main window's title matches the expected value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is launched, **When** the main window loads, **Then** the title should be "Expected Title".

---

### User Story 2 - Test UI Components (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to interact with key UI components (e.g., dialogs, buttons) to ensure they function as expected.

**Why this priority**: Validates the usability and functionality of critical UI components.

**Independent Test**: Open each dialog and verify its elements are displayed and functional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running, **When** the "Create Plugin" dialog is opened, **Then** all input fields and buttons should be visible and functional.
2. **Given** the application is running, **When** the "Settings" dialog is opened, **Then** the settings options should be displayed correctly.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-31

- Q: Who are the primary users of the application, and are there distinct roles? → A: Single user role (all users have the same permissions).
- Q: How should the application display error, empty, and loading states for key UI components? → A: Use custom modals for errors and spinners/placeholders for empty/loading states.
- Q: What are the performance targets for the application (e.g., window load time, UI responsiveness)? → A: Window load time under 2 seconds, UI actions respond within 100ms.
- Q: Does the application integrate with any external services or APIs? → A: No external dependencies.
- Q: What are the key edge cases and failure scenarios the application should handle? → A: Handle advanced edge cases (e.g., concurrent actions, unexpected shutdowns).

### User Roles

- The application assumes a single user role where all users have the same permissions.

### Error, Empty, and Loading States

- **Error States**: The application will use custom modals to display error messages.
- **Empty States**: Placeholders will be shown when no data is available.
- **Loading States**: Spinners will be used to indicate loading processes.

### Performance Targets

- **Window Load Time**: The main application window must load in under 2 seconds.
- **UI Responsiveness**: All UI actions must respond within 100ms.

### Integration with External Dependencies

- The application does not integrate with any external services or APIs.

### Edge Cases and Failure Handling

- **Concurrent Actions**: The application must handle multiple user actions occurring simultaneously without errors.
- **Unexpected Shutdowns**: The application must recover gracefully from unexpected shutdowns, preserving user data.
- **Invalid Inputs**: The application must validate and handle invalid inputs without crashing.
- **No Data**: The application must display appropriate placeholders when no data is available.
